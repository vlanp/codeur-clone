This repository is a responsive web application that provides a very basic clone of two pages from the [codeur.com](https://www.codeur.com/) website. This repository serves as a foundation for using the [codeur automate](https://github.com/vlanp/CodeurAutomate) application.

The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is accessible [here](https://codeur-clone.netlify.app/).
